# Denoising Autoencoder in Python

## Overview
This project implements a Denoising Autoencoder using Python, TensorFlow, and Streamlit. The model aims to reduce noise in images while preserving essential features. The user can upload images through a web interface, and the model will denoise them using a trained autoencoder.

## Features
- **Image Denoising**: Effectively reduces noise from uploaded images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy image uploads and results display.
- **Image Processing**: Converts images to grayscale and resizes them for the model input.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install streamlit tensorflow pillow numpy
Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/denoise-model.git
cd denoise-model
2. Ensure you have your trained autoencoder model saved in the root directory (or adjust the path in the code).
3. 
Great! Based on your code for the denoising model using Streamlit and TensorFlow, here's an updated README that incorporates the specifics of your implementation:

Usage
To run the Streamlit application, execute the following command in your terminal:
streamlit run app.py
Replace app.py with the name of your Python file if it's different.

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501.
Performance Evaluation
You can evaluate the effectiveness of the denoising model qualitatively by comparing the original and denoised images visually. Future improvements may include quantitative metrics like PSNR and SSIM.
